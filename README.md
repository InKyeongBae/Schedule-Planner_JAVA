## How to Compile
1. Prepare the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers or IntelliJ IDEA
2. Open the Project file that you want to execute.
3. Eclipse IDE works compilation and execution at once when pressing run (ctrl + F11)


## Function
1) When the program is performed, it reads the schedule information in the specified file (e.g., schedule-file.data) and stores it in the internal data structure, displaying the month schedule and the day schedule for today.

2) When a specific date is selected in the monthly schedule, the Day Schedule displays the schedule for the selected day.

3) Click on the "<", ">" button in the Monthly calendar -> Move the month

4) Implement "Cancel", "Add", "Save" on a Daily schedule

## Project GOAL
- Practice object-oriented program design : Method Overloading, Inheritance, Abstraction
- Define required classes, divide functions by class
- Gain management challenges and Java solutions as programs grow in size
- Learn all the key Java features you have learned during the semester
- Basic GUI, File I/O, String Processing (Simple DB Programming)
- Event-driven programming, object reference processing
